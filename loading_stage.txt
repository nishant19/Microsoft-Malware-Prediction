The data is quite big here, and all of it cannot be loaded at once with a simple read_csv call.

Here are the types we've used :

I load objects as categories, object is fine as well.
Binary values are switched to int8
Binary values with missing values are switched to float16 (int does not understand nan), it is possible to use category here as well.
64 bits encoding are all switched to 32, or 16 of possible

So, the approach has been to switch data types to gain memory effectively.
